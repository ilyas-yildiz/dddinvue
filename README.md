Dynamic Dependent Dropdown in Vue.js using Codeigniter

ROAD MAP

1- In the view file named welcome_message.php, we include bootstrap, vuejs and axios via cdn, respectively.
2- In the post part of axios, you write the controller that you will send the data to. We will perform database operations with outgoing data.
3- This is how you pull the "request_for" data sent with axios; 
json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"))
4- That's the deal. Open your view file in your browser and see the result.
